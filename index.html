                Etymology
                Historical records show that the city's name was once "Kammamettu.".[7][8][9][10][11][12] The name was also anglicized as "Comment" and "Khammammet".[13]
                
                History
                The name Khammam, which means a pillar is named after lord Narasimha Swamy, the presiding deity of Narasimhaswamy Gutta, an important pilgrimage site for the locals. Because of the presence of Lord Narasimhaswami temple in Khammam, the city was named Sthambadri earlier. The city is located on the banks of a river called Munneru which is a tributary of the Krishna River. Khammam district has a lot of historical importance in Telangana.
                
                Khammam City, which was the seat of the Taluk Administration, was part of the larger Warangal District, until 1 October 1953. Five taluks of the Warangal district viz., Khammam, Madhira, Yellandu, Burgampadu, and Paloncha (now Kothagudem) were carved out and a new district Khammam with Khammam as District Headquarters. In 1959 Bhadrachalam Revenue Division consisted of Bhadrachalam and Nuguru Venkatapuram Taluks of East Godawari district, which were on the other side of the river Godavari were merged into Khammam on grounds of geographical contiguity and administrative viability.
                
                In 1973, a new taluk with Sathupalli as its headquarters was carved out from Madhira and Kothagudem taluks. In the year 1976 four new taluks were formed viz., Tirumalayapalem, Sudimalla, Aswaraopeta and Khammam district was initially a part of larger Warangal District.
                
                History of Khammam shows that it has produced a number of leaders who were part of the Freedom struggle, such as first generation Communist leaders Peravelli Venkata Ramanaiah, Pendyala Satyanarayana Rao, Sarvadevabhatla Ramanatham, K.L.
